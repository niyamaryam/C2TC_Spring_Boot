Spring_Boot CRUD Operations

Project Overview

Your “Placement Management System” is a comprehensive system with six main modules, each serving a specific purpose within the application. Below, we’ll break down each module and the key classes and components used in your project:

1. Student Module

	•	The “Student” module is responsible for managing student profiles and information related to placements.
	•	Key Components:
	•	Controller: Handles incoming requests related to students, such as creating and updating profiles.
	•	Entity: Represents the “Student” entity with details like name, contact information, and academic records.
	•	Repository: Provides database access and CRUD operations for student data.
	•	Service: Implements business logic related to students.

2. Placement Module

	•	The “Placement” module deals with managing and tracking placement opportunities for students.
	•	Key Components:
	•	Controller: Manages placement-related requests, like posting job opportunities and tracking student placements.
	•	Entity: Represents placement opportunities and related information.
	•	Repository: Enables data storage and retrieval for placement-related data.
	•	Service: Implements placement-specific business logic.

3. User Module

	•	The “User” module is responsible for handling user authentication and access control.
	•	Key Components:
	•	Controller: Manages user authentication, registration, and profile-related requests.
	•	Entity: Represents user accounts with fields like username, password, and roles.
	•	Repository: Handles user data storage and retrieval.
	•	Service: Implements user authentication and authorization logic.

4. Admin Module

	•	The “Admin” module is designed for administrators to manage system-wide settings and configurations.
	•	Key Components:
	•	Controller: Provides endpoints for administrators to adjust system settings.
	•	Entity: Represents admin-specific data or settings.
	•	Repository: Manages storage and retrieval of admin-related data.
	•	Service: Implements admin-specific logic for configuring the system.

5. Certificate Module

	•	The “Certificate” module is responsible for handling certificates or documents related to student placements.
	•	Key Components:
	•	Controller: Manages requests for generating, storing, and retrieving certificates.
	•	Entity: Represents certificate data, including templates and student-specific details.
	•	Repository: Enables storage and retrieval of certificate-related information.
	•	Service: Implements certificate generation and management logic.

6. College Module

	•	The “College” module deals with managing information about educational institutions.
	•	Key Components:
	•	Controller: Handles requests related to colleges, such as adding or updating college information.
	•	Entity: Represents colleges with details like name, location, and courses offered.
	•	Repository: Manages data storage and retrieval for colleges.
	•	Service: Implements business logic related to colleges.

Common Components

	•	Application Main Class: This is the entry point of your Spring Boot application, where the application is initialized and runs

 Spring Boot is a popular Java framework for building web applications, and Postman is a widely used tool for testing and documenting APIs. CRUD operations refer to Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on data. Here’s a high-level overview of how to perform CRUD operations with Spring Boot using Postman:

	1.	Create a Spring Boot Application:
	•	Start by creating a Spring Boot application with the necessary dependencies for web development, such as Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, and a database driver (e.g., H2, MySQL, PostgreSQL).
	2.	Define an Entity Class:
	•	Create a Java class representing the entity you want to perform CRUD operations on. Annotate it with @Entity to make it a JPA entity.
	3.	Create a Repository:
	•	Create a repository interface by extending JpaRepository or a related interface. This interface will provide CRUD methods for your entity.
	4.	Implement Controller:
	•	Create a REST controller with methods to handle CRUD operations. Use annotations like @RestController, @GetMapping, @PostMapping, @PutMapping, and @DeleteMapping to define the endpoints.
	5.	Use Postman:
	•	Open Postman and start a new request collection.
	•	Define individual requests for each CRUD operation:
 
	a.	Create (POST):
	•	Set the request type to POST.
	•	Specify the endpoint URL for creating a new entity.
	•	Provide JSON data in the request body with the details of the new entity.
	•	Send the request.
 
	b.	Read (GET):
	•	Set the request type to GET.
	•	Specify the endpoint URL for retrieving entities.
	•	Send the request to retrieve a list of entities.
 
	c.	Update (PUT):
	•	Set the request type to PUT.
	•	Specify the endpoint URL for updating an existing entity.
	•	Provide JSON data in the request body with the updated details.
	•	Send the request.
 
	d.	Delete (DELETE):
	•	Set the request type to DELETE.
	•	Specify the endpoint URL for deleting an entity.
	•	Send the request.
	6.	Test CRUD Operations:
	•	Execute the individual requests you’ve created in Postman to test the CRUD operations on your Spring Boot application.

Make sure your Spring Boot application is running while you perform these requests in Postman. The requests should map to the endpoints you’ve defined in your Spring Boot application’s controller.
